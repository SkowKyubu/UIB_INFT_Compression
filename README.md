# Data Compression Algorithms Overview

## Project Summary
This repository presents implementations of two fundamental data compression algorithms: Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) and Huffman encoding. These algorithms are widely used in various applications to reduce the size of data while preserving its information content.

## Contents
The project comprises two main sections:

### Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
- Compression: The LZW algorithm compresses data by replacing repeated sequences of characters with codes, thereby reducing redundancy.
- Decompression: Decompression reverses the compression process to reconstruct the original data from the encoded values.
### Huffman Encoding
- Huffman Coding: Huffman encoding creates a binary tree based on the frequencies of characters in the data and assigns variable-length codes to each character.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applications of LZW and Huffman encoding algorithms in data compression tasks. These algorithms play a crucial role in various domains such as data transmission, storage, and multimedia compression. By understanding and implementing these algorithms, developers gain insights into how to efficiently manage and manipulate data to optimize storage and transmission resources.
